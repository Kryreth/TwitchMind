FIXES & TECHNICAL ISSUES
1. Speech-to-AI Chain Broken

Problem: Mic input is working, and transcription is captured, but the system fails to pass that transcribed text to the AI (e.g. Grok or any replacement for OpenAI).

Expected Fix:

Ensure transcribed text is sent to the AI endpoint correctly.

AI should generate a response and return it to the TTS module.

Audio should then be routed back into headset and optionally out to Stream output or Discord.

Add error logging if AI fails to respond or text isn‚Äôt passed.

2. Test Button Not Fetching Clips

Problem: The test/play button beside each VIP in VIP management doesn‚Äôt play their latest Twitch clip.

Expected Fix:

When pressed, use Twitch Helix API (/clips) to fetch latest public clip for the username.

Clip should auto-play in the UI preview window.

Handle edge cases (e.g. no public clips or error 403/401).

üí¨ CHAT & UI EXPERIENCE
3. Switch to Real Twitch Chat Experience

Problem: Live chat window is AI-focused with summaries or ‚Äúpositivity feeds,‚Äù not functional for streamers/mods.

Expected Behavior:

Show real Twitch chat feed.

Enable redemptions, timeouts, mod actions, emotes, channel point responses.

Optional: toggle between "Raw Chat" and "AI Chat Summary" views.

4. Move Sentiment Labels to Analytics

Current Behavior: AI tags every user message as neutral/positive/negative or bot in the live chat window.

New Behavior:

Remove tags from the chat.

In the Analytics tab, add a ‚ÄúSentiment‚Äù column per user.

Example:

User	Last Message	AI Summary	Sentiment
CatKing42	‚ÄúI love this game!‚Äù	Fan	Positive

5. Move Cooldown into VIP Management

Current Behavior: Cooldown for TTS shoutouts is buried in global settings.

New Behavior:

Add cooldown setting per VIP inside their VIP card.

Streamer can control it without leaving the VIP section.

6. Use Fixed Cooldown Options

Current Behavior: Cooldown is a freeform timer or slider, imprecise.

New Behavior:

Replace with dropdown or radio buttons:

1h, 2h, 4h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 1 week

Prevents streamer errors from inputting weird values like 99999s.

7. Show VIP Details Inline

Requested Additions:

Left of name: Display Twitch profile image (API: GET /users).

Right of name:

Follower count

Last live timestamp (API: GET /streams)

LIVE indicator (glow or badge if currently live)

‚ÄúOn path to affiliate‚Äù badge if follower count < 50

Viewer count (if currently live)

8. Enhanced Shoutout Command

New Features on Shoutout Trigger:

Run /shoutout command to Twitch via chat.

Autoplay latest clip (if exists).

Show the last game streamed (use GET /channels endpoint).

üîä AUDIO SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS
9. Dedicated Audio Settings Tab

Problem: Audio controls buried in unrelated panels.

New Panel:

New left sidebar item: ‚ÄúAudio Settings‚Äù

Contains all input/output/TTS/routing settings in one place.

10. Select Input/Output Devices

Expected Options:

Input: Microphones (e.g. XLR, USB, Voicemod, etc.)

Output: Speakers, headphones, virtual cables

Dropdowns populated from navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()

11. Audio Routing / Duplication

Goal: Hear StreamDachi audio AND route it to:

VTube Studio (e.g. via VB-Cable)

Discord (via default mic)

Solution:

Offer toggle: ‚ÄúDuplicate TTS output to selected input (virtual mic)‚Äù

Add dropdown for routing destination.
