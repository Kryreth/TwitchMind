6) Get OpenAI Responses Working (the issue you saw)

In the app:

Go to DachiStream

Make sure OpenAI model/personality are selected in AI Controls

Enable (optional) Auto-Send to Chat if you want answers posted to Twitch automatically

Go to your Twitch chat and send a few messages yourself (the AI needs inputs)

Watch Monitor:

Current Buffer should show your messages

You should see logs like “Selected message…”, then “AI responded.”

AI Responses counter increments

If nothing happens:

Re-check Secrets: is OPENAI_API_KEY present?

Restart the repl after adding it

Look at the Replit Console for errors like:

“Missing OPENAI_API_KEY”

“401 Unauthorized” (bad/expired key)

“OpenAI request failed”

Fix the key → restart → send chat again.

7) VIP: Add any Twitch user (what you asked for)

Open VIP Management:

In Add New VIP, type the exact Twitch username (even if they’ve never chatted with you)

Click Add VIP

You should see them appear in the VIP list immediately, with avatar and cooldown data.

If it says “not found” or doesn’t add:

Make sure you’re connected to Twitch (Settings → Twitch Connection)

Try the exact Twitch login (lowercase spelling matters)

If your panel shows a dropdown: you can either pick a suggestion or just press Add VIP with the exact name

Once added, they’re part of:

Auto-shoutouts (24-hour cooldown)

Priority system

Stored in the database for future streams

8) Token Refresh (so you don’t get logged out)

The system renews Twitch tokens automatically 7 days before expiration.

To allow refresh to run, keep the repl awake:

Enable Always On (Replit plan feature), or

Use a free uptime pinger (e.g., UptimeRobot) to hit your root URL every 5–10 minutes

In Settings, you should see token status/connection — if it shows expired, reconnect once; after that auto-refresh keeps it alive.

9) Countdown Timer & Live Updates

Go to Monitor

You should see Seconds Until Next Cycle changing in real time

If it’s frozen or blank:

Check top bar/WebSocket status (should show Connected)

If it’s disconnected, restart the repl and reload the page

Make sure you didn’t block mixed content or websockets in your browser

10) Personality Modes (impact on tone)

Go to AI Controls

Pick one: Casual / Comedy / Quirky / Serious / Gaming / Professional

Save/Apply

Send a test message in chat — the AI response style should match what you selected

11) DachiStream Settings (Consolidated)

Go to DachiStream

Configure:

Message Selection Strategy (most_active / random / new_chatter)

Response Modes (Database personalization / Streamer voice-only)

Topic Filters (Allowed / Blocked)

General (Enable DachiPool, Auto-Send, Energy Level, Mode, Max Characters)

Shoutouts & TTS (Auto shoutouts, cooldown, ElevenLabs toggle)

Priority Tiers (visual: Mods → Raids → VIPs → Subs/Bits → Regulars)

Everything saves immediately or via a visible Save button (depending on the panel).

12) Quick Acceptance Test (5 minutes)

Do these in order to confirm it’s all good:

Twitch Connect → shows “Connected as …”

OpenAI Key → present in Secrets, repl restarted

Chat Test → send “hello” in your Twitch chat

Monitor → shows your message in Current Buffer

AI Response → counter increments; if Auto-Send enabled, it posts in chat

VIP Add → type any real Twitch username, press Add VIP, see it appear

Countdown → timer on Monitor ticks down and resets each cycle

Personality → switch to “Comedy”, send another chat line, see tone change

If any of those 8 fail, tell me which exact step failed and what the screen said, and I’ll zero in on that spot.
